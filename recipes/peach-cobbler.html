        <h3>Cuddle Up with Cobbler</h3>
        <p>
          Here's a quick and easy recipe I make for my family when we go camping
          on the weekends. After a long hike, there's nothing better than
          sitting around the fire and eating cobbler with the people you love.
          <em>Enjoy!</em>
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>5 peaches , peeled, cored and sliced (about 4 cups)</li>
          <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>6 Tablespoons butter</li>
          <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>3/4 cup mil></li>
          <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add the sliced peaches, sugar and salt to a saucepan and stir to
            combine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook on medium heat for just a few minutes, until the sugar is
            dissolved and helps to bring out juices from the peaches. Remove
            from heat and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice butter into pieces and add to a
            9x13 inch baking dish. Place the pan in the oven while it preheats,
            to allow the butter to melt. Once melted, remove the pan from the
            oven.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and
            salt. Stir in the milk, just until combined. Pour the mixture into
            the pan, over the melted butter and smooth it into an even layer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spoon the peaches and juice (or canned peaches, if using) over the
            batter. Sprinkle cinnamon generously over the top.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake at 350 degrees for about 38-40 minutes. Serve warm, with a
            scoop of ice cream, if desired.
          </li>
        </ol>
