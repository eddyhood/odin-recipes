        <h3>Enjoy Your Summer with Ribs</h3>
        <p>
          Everyone in my family loves a good plate of ribs, especially in the
          summer. Get enough people around the BBQ, and you can make the world a
          better place. This is my family's favorite way to do just that.
          <em>Enjoy!</em>
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 to 2 1/2 pounds baby back pork ribs</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>1/4 cup finely diced onion</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
          <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon hot chili sauce (suggestion Sriracha)</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
          <li>Salt and ground pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat oven to 275° Fahrenheit (135C).</li>
          <li>
            If the ribs still have the thin membrane covering the back of the
            rack, remove it. See how in the notes section below.
          </li>
          <li>
            Season both sides of the ribs with a generous amount of salt and
            pepper. If you are using a spice rub, add season the ribs with it
            now. Place the ribs, meat-side up, into a large roasting pan or
            rimmed baking sheet. (It may be necessary to cut the ribs in half
            for them to fit into the pan).
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover the pan or baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil, and then
            bake until the meat falls easily from the bones, 2 ½ to 3 ½ hours.
            We like to check the ribs after 2 hours to see how they are
            progressing. The ribs are done when the meat is cooked through and
            tender.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the ribs bake, make the barbecue sauce. Heat the olive oil in
            a saucepan over medium heat.

            a saucepan over medium heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the ketchup, hot chili sauce, brown sugar, and apple cider
            vinegar. Stir to combine, season with salt then cook for 2 minutes.
            Set aside in preparation for the ribs to finish roasting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the ribs from the oven, discard the aluminum foil and
            generously brush both sides with barbecue sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optional: Move an oven rack near the top of the oven. Turn broiler
            to high and broil the ribs for 3-4 minutes, just until the barbecue
            sauce begins to caramelize. (Keep a close eye on the ribs while they
            broil so the sauce does not burn.)
