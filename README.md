HTML assignment for The Odin Project

This is the first assignment for The Odin Project, an online and open-source learning platform for people learning how to code.

In this assignment, I will be making a basic HTML recipe website. The goals of this assignment are: - To create links to some recipe pages - Practice my HTML knowledge

I am not expected to style this with CSS, as this is an HTML only assignment.
